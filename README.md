# Q: What is EasySpawn?
### A: EasySpawn is a simple 1-command minecraft plugin that sends users back to the world spawn when the command is used.

# Q: What command do I use?
### A: The command by default is `/spawn`, but it has many aliases, including `/home`, `/worldspawn`, and `reset`.

# Q: Can I reset the spawn point?
### A: Yes! Simply use the built-in `/setworldspawn` command. EasySpawn will teleport the player to whatever spawn you set it to.

# Q: I want to help contribute! Can I?
### A: Sure! I can always use help making the markdown better, or designing logos (which I'm not very good at ðŸ˜…). If you have some code suggestions, I would also love to hera them.
